    <h2>Florando</h2>
    <p>Florando, a traveling merchant  who has recently divorced. He is very eccentric and speaks in an obscure manner.  At first it is attempting to sell you some funky wares. Most likely a scam but the way he smiles! Oh so charming…who could not love Florando, our hammerhead friend? 
“C’mon take a look! There’s quite a lotta use you can get from a dinglehopper in your situation!”</p>

    <h2>Gobbler</h2>
    <p>Gobbler the Goblin, A rather forsaken entity visually. Oftentimes excluded and outright disrespected. Yet there is a kind heart in the stylish shark. Who enjoys the cuter things! Seems to be very unsure of why you approached…because this shark is not approaching anyone..!  
“Ah…the uhm weather was rather frightening earlier. Er but the weather..weather..”</p>
